= Plugin Description =

Once you've created fine-grained permissions for your content pages through Press Permit, you'll see an important feature is missing: A shorthand Widget or Shortcode [sv_pp_sacfu] to show all content which is hidden for public, but available for current user.

This plugin allows you to list those content to allow the currently logged in user to browse these. You won't need to maintenance such lists manually, these will always show all exclusive content available for that given user.
